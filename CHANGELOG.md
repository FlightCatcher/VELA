## VELA Desktop 4.16.0 — reliable image completion - 2026-08-03

- Restored rendering for historical ComfyUI records persisted as relative `view?...` URLs when the underlying output still exists.
- Added deterministic desktop media URL tests for ComfyUI, local files and absolute web data.
- Kept local file media behind the authenticated, workspace-restricted desktop endpoint.
- Automatically routes explicit natural-language image requests to the local ComfyUI pipeline without requiring the Image button first.
- Persists direct image prompts together with their generated media so image conversations survive a desktop restart.
- Correctly ends the working state when OpenClaw returns histories in newest-first or oldest-first order.
- Prevents duplicate OCU API processes by probing the loopback port before running deep health checks or starting a server.
- Preserved the VELA 1.8 liquid-glass desktop experience while hardening image history.

## VELA 1.6.0 — liquid glass UI and image model studio - 2026-08-03

- Rebuilt the desktop layout around a stable grid so the workflow deck, chat stream, composer and workspace panel no longer cover each other.
- Added neutral black, graphite and ivory liquid-glass surfaces with animated ambient light, spring entrances, message transitions, panel expansion and hover feedback.
- Added compact subject presets for anime characters, reference-locked characters, realistic portraits, landscapes and product photography.
- Added image engine choices for Anime/Animagine XL, Fast SDXL, FLUX.2 reference and realistic Juggernaut XL routing.
- Added a realistic image route that selects the photography checkpoint when the user chooses the realistic engine.
- Bumped renderer cache keys and desktop package version to 4.12.0 so the installed desktop app cannot silently reuse the previous UI.

- Added an explicit VELA 1.5 release marker to the desktop title bar and bootstrap metadata.
- Rebuilt and deployed the portable desktop executable to the local OpenClaw app directory.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Async Agent Runtime with bounded tool loops.
- Persistent sessions, rolling summaries and semantic memory.
- Structured Planner, DAG Executor, Reflection, bounded retry and plan revisions.
- Bidirectional OpenClaw plugin and CLI integration.
- Deterministic OpenClaw Browser reads.

- Allowlisted MCP stdio client.
- Incremental local knowledge indexing, hybrid retrieval and line citations.
- Loopback-only local JSON API and unified diagnostics.
- Repeatable bootstrap, OpenClaw integration, start, stop and verification scripts.

### Security

- OpenClaw Gateway credentials remain owned by OpenClaw.
- Workspace file tools enforce root boundaries.
- Shell remains disabled by default and uses a command allowlist when enabled.
- MCP servers are opt-in and loaded only from a local command allowlist.
- ComfyUI generation uses one preconfigured workflow rather than arbitrary workflow paths.
- The local API rejects non-loopback binding unless explicitly enabled.
